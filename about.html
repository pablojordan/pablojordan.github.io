						</div>


						<div class="col-lg-12 pt-60">
						<p>I started my career as an engineer in the Oil & Gas industry and then slowly transition into the field of engineering program management. I developed extensive experience in this arena managing various types of projects such as International Cross-well Seismic technology implementation, drill pipe & BHA equipment manufacturing, Quality Management Program for Drilling Operations onshore/offshore, Equipment Preventive Maintenance Programs and Test & Launch of new downhole equipment for wireline operations. </p>
						<p>I have always been involved in leading high profile projects that involve the implementation of new technologies, hence I always feel motivate and challenge by these types of projects. After my MBA graduation, I transitioned to the Insurance/Financial Services industry, leading digital transformation initiatives. I was able to transfer my program management skills smoothly in this new industry.</p>	
						<p>However, my inner engineer kicked in and I started to commit myself to learn more about the Data Analytics/Science field. I felt comfortable with the topic considering that my undergraduate degree in Industrial Engineer focused evenly in statistics, stochastics models, simulation and optimization. The more that I started to research and learn about the topic, the more excited I was about it. I could see how a combination of my engineer education, professional experience in program management and development knowledge of data science could make me a hybrid professional that would be excited to dedicate his entire career in the field of Data Science.

											<a href="" class="active">Why did you make this website?</a>
										</dt>
										<dd style="display: block;">
										<p>I created this website with two main goals in mind. First, I wanted to continue practicing the web design process of creating my personal website. This allows me to generate new ideas when developing analytics dashboard designs. Second, I saw a business opportunity to show who I am and the type of work that I am interested in. This way potential hiring managers and clients would have a better sense of my background, knowledge, and capabilities. 

										</p>

										</dd>

										<dt>
											<a href="">How long have you been practicing Data Science/Analytics?</a>
										</dt>
										<dd style="display: none;">
										<p>Well, I have been practicing data analytics for over 5 years. Now, it is fair to say that most of my data analysis, descriptive models and predictive models were completed in Excel. Yes, Excel is a great tool where you can easily analyze data, create dashboards and even use Excel Solver to find the optimal desired output of a model. I have even used @Risk add on in Excel to create Monte Carlo analysis, sensitivity analysis, and decision trees analysis thanks to the extensive libraries of probabilities distribution, data fitting and correlation modeling of this add on. </p>
										
										<p>I was until last year that I came to realize the dangerous limitations of Excel with Big Data. Therefore, I decided to learn other programming languages such as Python that allow me to do the same or more than Excel. </p>
										
									    </dd>

										<dt>
											<a href="">Do you have any experience working with databases?</a>
										</dt>
										<dd style="display: none;">
										<p>I do not consider myself a database engineer. My experience with databases has been focused on ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) projects, and data query with Python to start the step of exploratory data analysis. I have used PostgreSQL, SQLite, Snowflake and AWS databases. </p>
										</dd>


										<dt>
											<a href="">Why are you interested in Data Science/Machine Learning projects instead of Digital Transformation projects?</a>
										</dt>
										<dd style="display: none;">
										<p>I believe that nowadays both types of strategic initiatives are key in any type of business. Digital Transformation allows you to create new or modifies the existing business processes, culture, customer experience to meet business and market requirements. Meanwhile, Data Science helps you to extract knowledge and insights from data by using a variety of methods, processes, algorithms, and systems. </p>
									    <p>I rather the latter one, because it is an excellent combination of applying my engineering technical skills while helping to drive business decisions with it.  </p>
										</dd>




									<dt>
										<a href=""> What kind of work do you see yourself doing? </a>
									</dt>
									<dd style="display: none;">
									<p>I am interested in helping executives to drive business decisions with Data Science. I see myself leading and execution the full cycle of strategic data science initiatives starting with the business problem definition, develop analytics framework, plan data extraction, develop a model methodology, create model, deploy model and plan model lifecycle management. </p>
